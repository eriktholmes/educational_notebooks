# Educational resources

I learn by doing, by building, by working to solve problems and by attempting to explain things to other. This is supposed to be a repo specifically for in depth writeups and from scratch builds. I will likely start with ML/AI resources since that is my current interest/focus on here. 

## ML Content: a beginning
1) [Basic MLP](/mlp_explained_pytorch.ipynb): A psuedo 'from scratch' notebook on MLPs. This mirrors the [micrograd](https://github.com/eriktholmes/Zero-to-hero-course/tree/main/episode-1/micrograd) documentation but with Pytorch for scaling purposes. Ultimately, the micrograd experimentation ended with the MNIST dataset. I figured I would write up a direct analogue of that basic setup using tensors and from there I would dive into the MLP on MNIST from a more interpretability perspective  since that is a nice place for visualization: [HERE](https://github.com/eriktholmes/interpreting_mnist) is where that will live.
2) ***To come:** I plan to do some similar 'bare bones' builds of CNNs and Transformers for both learning/teaching purposes.*
